prompt_template = """This task is to evaluate if the generated text contains hallucination given an input text. Hallucination is defined when there is information in the generated text that is not grounded in the input text or common sense. 

Here are a few examples of hallucination:

Example 1
Input text:  "We sell Caribbean vacation cruises"
Generated text: "We sell tropical cruises for 1999$"

Example 2
Input text:  "Best paper towels"
Generated text: "Best paper towels made in the USA"

Note that exaggerations that cannot be proven wrong, and that are often used in everydayâ€™s language are not hallucination. Here are a few examples of non hallucination examples:

Example 1
Input text:  "The best in town"
Generated text: "The greatest in the state"

Example 2
Input text:  "PLAY the #1 Bingo game on iPad for FREE!"
Generated text: "You can't win if you don't play the  Bingo game on iPad. PLAY NOW on iPad for FREE! ðŸ¤© Play with friends or family!"

Given this task description, does below texts contain hallucination?
Input text: {input_text}
Generated text: {generated_text}

Please provide your answer with a single word "True" if it contains hallucination, or "False" if it does not.
